/**
 * Wrapper for rich text styles.
 *
 * Bootstrap 5 follows a single-direction strategy for vertical margins.
 * Elements only have a margin-bottom, never a margin-top.
 * See https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/content/reboot/#approach.
 * Also https://csswizardry.com/2012/06/single-direction-margin-declarations/.
 *
 * Unfortunately, with this approach we cannot have extra vertical space above
 * e.g. h2 tags, to set a distance to previous content, if the margin-bottom of
 * that previous content is not sufficient. We want to add margin-top to at
 * least some headings.
 *
 * In headings defined in templates, this can be achieved with 'mt-*' utility
 * classes.
 *
 * In rich text, the margin-top will be added to all h* headings, based on a
 * '.bcl-text' wrapper. This is also what Bootstrap itself does in its doc
 * pages: Inspect the h2 headings in the doc page linked above!
 *
 * No special exception for :first-child is added, this will be compensated with
 * the 'eat-margin-*' classes instead.
